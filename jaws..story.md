<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original idea for Jaws was from when, as a kid walking around car shows, most of the cars started to look repetitive.&nbsp; I wanted to have a vehicle no one could guess, no markers, no trim -- even the most car-aficionado would wonder what drove past them.. but had a gnarly engine that makes a lot of power</font></p>

<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I was finally able to make this dream come true, I was 26, in the Marine Corps, on a budget, raising a young family.&nbsp; I'd love to have many cars, but I had to settle to combine all my loves into one.&nbsp; These are the cars I loved that made Jaws what she is today.<br></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p>

This is where I fell in love with paint jobs.&nbsp; Huge metal flake (Jaws almost had it if it wasn't so difficult to paint).&nbsp; The Themes again throughout the car, but in a completely different tone.&nbsp; Making the car a work of art.&nbsp; And of course, lowering the car til it scraped the ground, especially in the 80s when hydraulics like today just weren't as prevalent.</font></p><p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cut my springs poor man style, but really in homage of these works of art... maybe someday I'll have enough guts to airbrush some art on Jaws.</font></p><p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p>
