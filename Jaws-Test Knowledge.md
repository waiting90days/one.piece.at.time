## Test Your Knowledge

<body>The idea was to have a vehicle no one could guess -- even the most car-aficionado would wonder what drove past them
On a budget as I was 26, in the miltary, raising a young family<body>

### 1968 Pontiac Catalina

<body>Base - 1968 Pontiac Catalina coupe.  
Chosen for its perfect long swooping sail panel, and wide track of the large B-body GM vehicles.  Such beautiful contours from roof to trunk.  Add in 2000, barely anyone was fixing late-60s Catalinas and could be easily found under $2000<body>

<body>The Front clip, to include the front nose/bumper, front fenders and hood; and dashboard are from a 1967 Pontiac Grand Prix, found in a wrecking yard.
The front end of the GP has a far more custom and aggressive look than the nose of the 68 Catalina, and is reminiscent of the late-60s GTO, and also works better with chrome shaved off the body, and a painted bumper, with the bonus that the headlights are also hidden.
The sail panel of the 67 Grand Prix simply was not aggressive enough for my tastes, with its businessman-styling
I found the dash of the 68 Catalina expecially ugly, and the donor 67 Grand Prix's dash was far more aggressive, with a simplistic muscle car feel<body>

### Customization
	
<body>All exterior badges and chrome shaved or painted.  The original Pontiac Arrowhead (front bumper) is in the engine compartment, as is the "Pontiac" lettering (rear between the taillights) is in the trunk.
The car was lowered 2", poor-man-style by cutting the coil springs 
Many of the rear contours where flattened
