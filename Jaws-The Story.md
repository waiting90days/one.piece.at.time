<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original idea for Jaws was from when, as a kid walking around car shows, most of the cars started to look repetitive.&nbsp; I wanted to have a vehicle no one could guess, no markers, no trim -- even the most car-aficionado would wonder what drove past them.. but had a gnarly engine that makes a lot of power</font></p>

<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I was finally able to make this dream come true, I was 26, in the Marine Corps, on a budget, raising a young family.&nbsp; I'd love to have many cars, but I had to settle to combine all my loves into one.&nbsp; These are the cars I loved that made Jaws what she is today.<br></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p>

<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is always one car that starts it all... this was my Father's "Hot Rod" when I was a toddler.&nbsp; This is where I learned about stepping on the gas and taking a car to its limits, having a car is for the fun and love of driving, and glass packs of a loud exhaust make a heart race.&nbsp; My father put in many custom switches, most I no longer remember what they did, though I remember the ones that flipped off the tail and brake lights in case Police ever chased him due to speeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sadly, it was sold to pay for the hospital bills for my younger sister.&nbsp; Though my father would never own a hot rodded car again, it stoked in my heart the need for an engine that goes.&nbsp; My car needed the largest engine available, and it was needed to&nbsp;</font></p><p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p>

<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Panel trucks, loved the themed panel trucks that were fun as a kid to find as many of the hiding animals, skulls, etc hidden around the vehicle.<br>49 Mercs with Corvette grills, where my all time favorite rod... again, big, heavy, low tot he ground... and the lowest and widest windows.<br>The paint jobs, the flames/scallops, the hand pinstriping... the outrageous colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The idea that they didn't care about resale value or if anyone else liked their vehicle.&nbsp; It was built for them and no one else.&nbsp; A nice thumb to the "numbers-matching" crowd.&nbsp;<br>The idea to shave the chrome, paint the bumpers, the theme for kids to enjoy, and of course a custom color of sea foam green.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paint jobs... This is where I fell in love with paint jobs.&nbsp; Huge metal flake (Jaws almost had it if it wasn't so difficult to paint).&nbsp; The Themes again throughout the car, but in a completely different tone.&nbsp; Making the car a work of art.&nbsp; And of course, lowering the car til it scraped the ground, especially in the 80s when hydraulics like today just weren't as prevalent.</font></p><p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cut my springs poor man style, but really in homage of these works of art... maybe someday I'll have enough guts to airbrush some art on Jaws.</font></p><p><font color="#003471" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p>
